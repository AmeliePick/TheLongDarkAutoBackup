# About
This program does auto backup of The Long Dark saves. It's helpful, if
you don't want to lose your saves while playing in survival mode. Because in the survival
mode the game is removing the save file if you dead.

# How to use
+ For the first launch:
    + If you have a licensed version from Epic Games Store of the game, then go to
    EGS->Library and create a shortcut of the game. Place this shortcut to the folder
    with the program and type "true" or "1" to the program.

    + If your game is not a licensed version from Epic Games Store, you can  type
    "false" or "0" and specify the path to the game's .exe file.

+ In "Settings.ini" you can manage the time for auto backuping and specify a folder for backups.

For sure, to launch the game and backup start this program not the game itself. OwO

# Requirements
+ .Net Framework 4.8
